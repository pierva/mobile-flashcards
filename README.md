# Mobile Flash Cards App

This application is the final prject of the Udacity React Nanodegree. Specifically this application shows how we can use react native to develop mobile applications that look and feel like native apps.

The Mobile Flash Cards Application is a simple app that allow the user to create decks and add cards to the deck for his/her own challenge. The card are meant to have questions that the user should know the answer to. The user can guess the answer and view the answer, if the guess was correct, then presses the "Correct" button, otherwise the "Incorrect" one. At the end of the game, the application shows the score with the number of correct/incorrect guesses.

## Get Started
The application is written in react native using expo for the building.

If you don't have the Expo CLI installed, you can install it using:
```sh
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```

```

A new browser window will open up, then you can choose to test the application on the web, Android (emulator required if you are on mac) or iOS.
